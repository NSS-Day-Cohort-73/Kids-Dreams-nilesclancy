# Events and Debugging Assessment

Time to assess how well you have learned to use the debugging tools in Chrome Dev Tools, and writing click event listeners. This application is to show kids with illnesses and the memories the would like to make. Celebrities sign up to help kids make memories.

> ðŸ§¨ Make sure you answer the vocabulary and understanding questions at the end of this document before notifying your coaches that you are done with the project

## Event Listeners to Create

1. When the kid name is clicked, it should display their wish.
1. When the celebrity name is clicked, it should display their sport.
1. The pairings list should should contain the pairing in the following format.
    ```html
    {child name} will be making memories with {celebrity name}, a {celebrity sport} star, by {child wish}
    ```

Below is an animation showing how the application should look when complete and how the event listeners should work.

## Setup

Your instruction team will provide a link for you to create your assessment repository. Once your repo is created, clone it to your machine.

1. Make sure you are in your `workspace` directory.
1. `git clone {github repo SSH string}`.
1. `cd` into the directory it creates.
1. `code .` to open the project code.
1. Use the `serve` command to start the web server.
1. Open the URL provided in Chrome.

Make sure your Developer Tools are open at all times while working on this project. Use the messages provided in the Console to determine what code needs to be fixed or implemented, and use breakpoints in the Sources tab to step through your code as you debug.

## Vocabulary and Understanding

Before you click the "Complete Assessment" button on the Learning Platform, add your answers below each question and make a commit.

1. When a child is clicked on in the browser, which module contains the code that will execute on that event happening? Can you explain the algorithm of that logic?

   > The module containing the code to execute the event is main.js. This module houses the event listeners responsible for producing the interactions necessary for this project, and storing variable states to be referenced when the user clicks on an individual kid or celebrity. Algorithmically, the event listener function detects a click on a child, the data from that array object (or element) is retrieved from the event.target and and is stored in the selectedChild variable. Next, this variable is passed into the alert() function, generating an html string (alert) containing the child's name and wish.

2. In the **Pairings** module, why must the `findCelebrityMatch()` function be invoked inside the `for..of` loop that iterates the kids array?

   > The findCelebrityMatch() function must ne inside of the for/of loop because the loop's job is to connect each child.celebrityId with each celebrity.id. The Pairings function then uses findCelebrityMatch() to store its map of connected caleb and child ids into the kidStar variable which is passed into the html string(s)'s list items that the function renders.

3. In the **CelebrityList** module, can you describe how the name of the sport that the celebrity plays can be displayed in the window alert text?

   > The sport name can be displayed because the event listener function tasked with governing each celebrities' click event designates two variables, celebritySport and celebrityId, which both are assigned to the event.target.dataset of their respective namesakes. These variables are then assigned to selectedCelebrity, which is passed into the alert() function to generate the string shown when any celeb is clicked.

4. Can you describe, in detail, the algorithm that is in the `main` module?

   > The main module's algorithm begins by generating the html structure of the page that is passed into the the index body's main element (using the Celebrities(), Pairings() and Kids() functions). Next, the each selected...() function is assigned to null to set us a base state for each of those variables (considering they change based upon individual click events). After this the displayPairing() function renders the html strings of each pairing (using the selected...() functions) to the DOM, and resets their values to null (the base state) once again. Next, each event listener function creates variables to assign the properties of children and celebs, rendering these properties to the DOM only through alerts generated by their respective click events.
